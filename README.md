# Restaurant Page Project

This is my Restaurant Page project for The Odin Project. I successfully set up a Webpack environment and created a simple restaurant website with tabbed navigation.

## Features

- **Tabbed Navigation**: Users can switch between "Home", "Menu", and "Contact" pages.
- **Dynamic Content**: The content for each tab is generated using JavaScript modules.
- **Responsive Design**: Basic styling to ensure a good user experience.
  
## Reflection

This project helped me understand how to structure a web application using modules and manage state with JavaScript. I also learned how to use Webpack for bundling and serving my files.

I'm proud of the outcome and excited to continue building my skills!
